        - Configurable exit codes in the client (experimental).

0.28    22 October 2017
        - Client now supports resetting contact details (--update-contacts "none").
        - Old openssl version compatibility added (RT #123255).
        - Minor documentation changes.

        - PFX export fix for the client.

0.26    20 August 2017
        - Updated dependencies list for the old systems.
        - Windows binaries now provide PE metadata.
        - Minor documentation changes.

        - Added experimental support for PFX/P12 export (only available for Windows binaries).
        - Dropped Crypt::Format dependency to allow for cross-platform CSR loading.
        - Improved parameters handling.

0.24    02 July 2017
        - Certificate expiration check method 'check_expiration' has been added to the library (supports scalars, files, URLs).
        - Contact details methods 'contact_details' and 'update_contacts' have been added to the library.
        - Client can now be used to update contacts via 'update-contacts' parameter (multiple emails supported).
        - Client now supports a 'quiet' mode to suppress all messages but errors (via '--quiet' parameter).
        - Minor documentation changes.

0.23    25 April 2017
        - IDN (internationalized domain name) support has been added to the client. Note: the library itself was supporting
          this from the beginning, as long as you pass domain names in "punycode" form. Now the client application will
          encode such names into "punycode" for you if needed.
        - Domain verification process now uses domains in the specified order rather than sorted.
        - Domain verification is also supported by the client directly (no need to specify --handle-with).
        - If there is a challenge result flagged as 'valid' for the domain, it will be re-used.
        - Max amount of retries for waiting in 'pending' state can now be set (by default 300, resulting in 10 min wait time).

0.22    18 April 2017
        - Client will now postpone fetching the resource directory (so you can generate CSRs and keys completely offline).
        - Win32 and Win64 binaries are to be available with releases (at https://github.com/do-know/Crypt-LE/releases).
        - Minor documentation changes.

0.21    17 April 2017
        - Multi-webroot support added (for multiple domains on the same certificate having different webroots).
        - Renew expiration date check should now also work with old libraries not reporting certificate depth.
        - Domains method should now return loaded domains in the same order as provided rather than sorted.
        - Help output from the client is narrowed down to fit small screens like Windows console better.
        - Minor documentation changes.

0.20    01 April 2017
        - CSRs can now be generated on Windows.
        - ECC is now supported (as long as you have Net:SSLeay version 1.75 or better).
        - Keys are now generated using Net::SSLeay, Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA is only used for utility purposes and might be removed later.
        - Main le.pl script accepts a new parameter 'curve' for EC keys, you can use 'default' as a value for 'prime256v1'.
        - Mail le.pl script accepts a new parameter 'issue-code' to set specified exit code on certificate issuance/renewal.
        - Main le.pl script will exit with code 255 on error, 0 otherwise.
        - Dropped non-portable Crypt::OpenSSL::PKCS10 dependency.
        - Removed Crypt:::PKCS10 dependency.

0.19    16 October 2016
        - Legacy option (--legacy) is now supported (for AWS services, old Apache versions, some Control Panels and specific
          devices). In this mode domain keys are generated with 2048 bits instead of 4096 and certificate file only contains
          the domain certificate, the issuer's one is saved separately.
        - Certificate revocation should now work for the certificate files containing the full chain - the first certificate
          in the file will be used.
        - Improved client error messaging (for the account key and CSR parameters handling).
        - Minor changes for the upcoming ECC support.
        - Minor documentation fixes.

0.18    21 August 2016
        - Loading keys, CSR and certificate is now possible from variables. Passing the string to "load_account_key",
          "load_csr", "load_csr_key" or "revoke_certificate" functions works as before and treated as a filename.
          The scalar reference though will be treated as an actual content of the key, CSR or certificate.
          That allows such data to be stored in a database for example, but used with the Crypt::LE library.
        - The case of the blacklisted domains (those are similar to well-known brands for example) is handled better
          and the client will stop early with producing appropriate messages, before even attempting to request any
          challenges.
        - Additional check for domain names, both entered as a parameter and loaded from CSR, is implemented.
          This should cover the cases of attempting to use unsupported by LE entity types (such as URI, IP, email)
          and attempts to request wildcard certificates (also not supported by LE at the moment).
        - Registration ID for the key is now accessible directly with "registration_id" call and reported by the client.

0.17    14 May 2016
        - Additional functions set_domains/verified_domains have been added to work with domain names and to make it possible 
          to run the verification process before loading/generating a CSR.
        - The failed_domains method has been modified and now returns the list of domains failed the verification on any of 
          the request/accept/verify steps if called with a true value as a parameter. Otherwise the list of domains failed 
          the process on the most recently called request/accept/verify step gets returned (as usual).
        - Online resource to generate RSA keys and Certificate Signing Requests is referenced and to be available soon at
          https://get.zerossl.com/ (should help with CSR on Win32/Win64).

0.16    14 May 2016
        - Configuration changes to allow building PPM for pure Win23/Win64 environments.

0.15    01 April 2016
        - While generating a new CSR you can now use your existing key (if the file named in csr-key exists). Previously 
          generating a CSR would have also created a new key with it.
        - Even though tokens from LE should be technically safe (base64url), in case something gets changed by accident or 
          gets broken, they will be checked for matching the expected alphabet as per RFC 4648 section 5 (you don't want 
          something like / to sneak in).
        - Version typo fix.

0.14    28 March 2016
        - LICENSE file has been added.
        - Minimum Perl version is now explicitly specified.
        - A bit of tidying up.

0.13    28 March 2016
        - Simplified a few blocks of code in the client.
        - Moved pod in the client out of the way.
        - Added Markdown version of README.

0.12    27 March 2016
        - Library now supports 'logger' parameter to log debug messages via external logger (otherwise printed to STDOUT).
        - Client logging is now done via Log::Log4perl and supports --log-config parameter, so you can configure logging
          to your liking (example of a configuration file is given in help).
        - Client WILL NOT ask for domain verification now if previous verification results are still valid - that should
          allow renewals to be done without re-verification for about a year. Note: that makes --verified parameter obsolete.
        - Client now allows email to be used for registration.
        - Client is largely rewritten and the new home for the project is referenced (https://ZeroSSL.com)
        - On domain verification failure the error message is available now to callbacks under the 'error' key of results.
        - Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple can now use the logger passed to it by the client.
        - Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple is now also given a list of domains the certificate is issued for.
        - Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple can now use the logger passed to it by the client (or other application).
        - Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple now has DNS verification example added.
        - Client now supports basic DNS verification by using the following parameters in a command line:

          --handle-as dns --handle-with Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple

0.11    21 March 2016
        - Added an option for conditional renew (--renew XX, where XX is the number of days left until expiration) to le.pl client.
          Expiration can be checked either locally (by reading an existing certificate file) or remotely (by connecting to the website
          using that certificate).
        - Added an option to unlink challenge files automatically (--unlink) to le.client. Note: it only works in combination with 
          existing --path option, which automatically places the challenge files into the target directory.

0.10    16 March 2016
        - Minor documentation changes.
        - Text in Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple handler brought in line with le.pl.

0.09    15 March 2016
        - Client (and the library of course) now also supports optional callback for verification,
          so you can clean up challenge files or react in some way depending on the verification process outcome.
        - Minor documentation fixes.

0.08    15 March 2016
        - Added MIME::Base64 version dependency to make it work in a specific NetBSD environment.
        - Client le.pl will not require 'crt' parameter in generate-only mode any more.
        - Brushed up documentation.

0.07    14 March 2016
        - Certificate revocation now handles "already revoked" status better.
        - Both 'handle-params' and 'complete-params' can now take JSON document with parameters either directly or by reading it from file.
          So it should be now even easier to create 'handle' and 'complete' plugins and pass parameters to those without changing anything
          in the client itself.

0.06    14 March 2016
        - Added certificate revocation to both the library (Crypt::LE) and the client (le.pl).
        - Improved documentation and le.pl usage help.
        - Added HTTP::Tiny dependencies for NetBSD/OpenBSD boxes, which don't have IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay
          installed by default.

0.05    13 March 2016
        Client: In addition to be able to use external challenge handlers, le.pl can now also use completion handlers. Example:

        le.pl ... --complete-with Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple --complete-params '{"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": "something"}'

        The module handling process completion should have a 'complete' method defined, to which both the completion data
        (including the domain and issuer's certificate, certificate file name and key file name) and the parameters given
        with '--complete-params' will be passed.

0.04    13 March 2016
        Library: accept_challenge() now takes optional parameters, which can be then passed to a callback.
        Client: le.pl now supports passing parameters to external challenge handling modules. Example:

        le.pl ... --handle-with Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple --handle-params '{"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": "something"}'

0.03    13 March 2016
        Client (le.pl) now supports "handle-with" and "handle-as" parameters, so external 
        challenge handling modules (such as Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple) can be easily used.

0.02    12 March 2016
        Minor documentation fix.

0.01    12 March 2016
        Initial version.
