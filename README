Crypt-LE

The Crypt::LE module provides the functionality necessary to use Let's Encrypt API and generate free SSL 
certificates for your domains. It can also be used to generate private RSA (and from version 0.20 also ECC)
keys or Certificate Signing Requests without resorting to openssl command line.

COMPATIBILITY

The code has been successfully tested on more than 500 combinations of OS and Perl versions. It should install
and run fine on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc. It also works on Mac OS X and Windows (tested with ActiveState and
Strawberry Perl).

In addition, if you are able to run docker containers, you can pull the latest client image from
https://hub.docker.com/r/zerossl/client/. Docker image is lightweight and the client is run as a non-privileged
user in a container.

REQUIREMENTS

LINUX: There are just 3 essential things which should be in place for the package to be successfully installed:
"gcc", "make" and the SSL development package. The SSL development package name differs depending on 
Linux distribution and it can be either "libssl-dev" or "openssl-devel". 

WINDOWS: There are no requirements if Raspberry Perl is used. For ActiveState Perl you may need to install CPANminus
first (business license users of ActiveState have direct access to Crypt::LE ppm). You can also use Windows binaries.

See https://zerossl.com/installation.html for more details.

INSTALLATION

- With CPANminus

  cpanm Crypt::LE

- With CPAN

  cpan -i Crypt::LE

- Manual installation:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

- Windows installation (with Strawberry Perl)

  cpanm -f Log::Log4perl
  cpanm Crypt::LE

Note: On Windows current version of the logging module needs to be installed with -f flag first if Strawberry Perl is used.

PLUGINS

Crypt::LE can be easily extended with custom plugins to handle Let's Encrypt challenges. See Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple module
as an example of such plugin.

CLIENT

Crypt::LE is shipped with a self-sufficient client for obtaining SSL certificates - le.pl. Run it without parameters to see how it is used.
The client supports 'http' and 'dns' challenges out of the box.

Usage example: le.pl --key account.key --csr domain.csr --csr-key domain.key --crt domain.crt --domains "www.domain.ext,domain.ext" --generate-missing

That will generate an account key and a CSR if they are missing. If any of those files exists, they will just be loaded, so it is safe to re-run
the client. The client application can be very easily extended with modules handling challenges and modules handling the process completion. For
examples see Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple and Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple. Related options of le.pl are:

 --handle-with
 --handle-params
 --handle-as
 --complete-with
 --complete-params

Please note that parameters for --handle-params and --complete-params are expected to be valid JSON documents or to point to files containing
valid JSON documents.

Note: If you would like to receive expiration notifications for your domain, you can specify --email parameter and an appropriate email address
during the initial registration of the account. Later, shall you want to change your email or specify more than one, you can use --update-contacts
parameter to update your contact information.

For example: le.pl --key account.key --update-contacts "one@email.address, another@email.address" --live

To reset your contact details, please specify "none" as a value, as follows: le.pl --key account.key --update-contacts "none" --live

PFX/P12 SUPPORT

Windows binaries include export functions into PFX/P12 format, which is normally required by IIS. The export (in addition to saving certificates in
PEM format) can be activated by specifying a PFX password with '--export-pfx' option.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
