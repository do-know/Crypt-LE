Crypt-LE

The Crypt::LE module provides the functionality necessary to use Let's Encrypt API and generate free SSL 
certificates for your domains. It can also be used to generate private RSA keys or Certificate Signing Requests
without resorting to openssl command line.

REQUIREMENTS

There are just 3 essential things which should be in place for the package to be successfully installed: 
"gcc", "make" and the SSL development package. The SSL development package name differs depending on 
Linux distribution and it can be either "libssl-dev" or "openssl-devel". 
See https://zerossl.com/install-and-use.html for more details.

INSTALLATION

- With CPANminus

  cpanm Crypt::LE

- With CPAN

  cpan -i Crypt::LE

- Manual installation:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

PLUGINS

Crypt::LE can be easily extended with custom plugins to handle Let's Encrypt challenges. See Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple module
as an example of such plugin.

CLIENT

Crypt::LE is shipped with a self-sufficient client for obtaining SSL certificates - le.pl. Run it without parameters to see how it is used.
The client supports 'http' and 'dns' challenges out of the box.

Usage example: le.pl --key account.key --csr domain.csr --csr-key domain.key --crt domain.crt --domains "www.domain.ext,domain.ext" --generate-missing

That will generate an account key and a CSR if they are missing. If any of those files exists, they will just be loaded, so it is safe to re-run
the client. The client application can be very easily extended with modules handling challenges and modules handling the process completion. For
examples see Crypt::LE::Challenge::Simple and Crypt::LE::Complete::Simple. Related options of le.pl are:

 --handle-with
 --handle-params
 --handle-as
 --complete-with
 --complete-params

Please note that parameters for --handle-params and --complete-params are expected to be valid JSON documents or to point to files containing
valid JSON documents.

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
